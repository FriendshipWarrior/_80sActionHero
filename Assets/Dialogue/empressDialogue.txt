Empress: Welcome.
Boy: I recognize you...
Empress: You do?
Boy: Yes, you're the Childlike Empress from The Neverending Story.
Empress: Very good, you know your movies.
Boy: Where am I?
Empress: You are in limbo, a world between worlds.
Boy: What brought me here? I just wanted to watch Conan.
Empress: The VCR your mother bought is magical, it's more than a simple player.
Boy: You saying it is a teleportation device?
Empress: Precisly, and right now, we need your help!
Boy: What is it?
Empress: All the heroes from action movies are disappearing.
Boy: You mean Conan is gone?
Empress: Yes, and we need you to travel to each world and embody these heroes.
Boy: I need to be the hero?
Empress: Yes, Kyle Reese is missing and Sarah Connor is in danger. Predator is hunting in Central American unchecked, unchallanged.
Boy: Then I must go!
Empress: The VHS's work as keys to the world. I see you have the Conan tape, and use it to go to his world. Thulsa Doom and his cult are raiding villages and stole the king's daughter. You need to go and bring her back! 
Boy: How am I suppose to do that?
Empress: Take this sword and use your knowledge of these films as a guide. Also, this...
Boy: The Ayurn?
Empress: It is my pendant, may it protect you. 
Boy: Thank you, Moonchild.
