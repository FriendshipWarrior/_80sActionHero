Thulsa Doom: Hello, boy. I have been expecting you.
Boy: You were?
Thulsa Doon: Yes, indeed. Since my nemesis Conan has gone missing, I expected a new hero to take his place.
Boy: Then you know I am here to stop you.
Thulsa Doom: I am immortal boy, I cannot be stopped.
Boy: I've seen the movie, I know that's not true.
Thulsa Doom: Movie? Do you speak in riddles, boy? I love riddles. My favorite is the riddle of steel, have you heard it?
Boy: Yes. What is steel compared to the hand that weilds it?
Thulsa Doom: Precisely! A weapon is only as strong as its master. Now, prepare to face my weapon, made from the Crimmean people, a true weapon of war.
