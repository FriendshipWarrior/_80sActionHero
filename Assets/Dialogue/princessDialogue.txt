Princess: Thank you for saving me, I was under his spell and could not think or act for myself.
Boy: No problem, princess, I am happy to help.
Princess: I see you have my family's gem. If you return it, I will give you an artifact in exchange.
Boy: What artifact is that?
Princess: I do not know, it is made of strange material, of which I do not know it's origin.
Boy: Oh! A VHS tape of Predator. Thank you, I need this.
Princess: I do not know what you speak of, but I hope the Gods will find favor with you again.
Boy: And you too princess.
