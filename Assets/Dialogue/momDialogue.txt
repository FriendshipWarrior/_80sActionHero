Son: Hi, mom. Did you get the VHS player fixed?
Mom: No, Son. The repairman said it is beyond repair.
You ruined it from using it so much.
Son: Oh no, how am I gonna watch my movies?
Mom: Well, maybe you should get your head out of the clouds and 
do some chores and homework.
Son: That's no fun.
Mom: I did get a new player though.
Son: Really!?
Mom: Yes. The electronic stores were all out and I was only able to find one 
in an old oddity shop. It looks unusual, but I'm sure it plays just fine.
Son: I'm excited to try it out now.
Mom: Did you finish your homework.
Son: Yes...
Mom: Okay, only one movie though!
Son: Fine.
